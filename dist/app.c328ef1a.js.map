The viewer has the opportunity to audition 5 actresses for the same role of Kaos, sidekick to the superhero in the superhero movie “Bang &amp; Kaos”. The viewer is a casting director and decides who gets called back. The theme was diversity in casting. I picked actresses of different ethnicities and using Interlude’s (now acquired by eKo) platform created an experience where the user can make a decision to cast the role. Through this work I addressed my own challenges as an actor in the audition room as a person of color.  I developed the concept, served as director, editor and producer.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</section>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\n\timport Navigation from './Navigation'\r\n\texport default {\r\n\t\tname: 'Digital',\r\n\t\tcomponents: {\r\n\t\t\tNavigation,\r\n        },\r\n\t\tcreated() {\r\n            this.msg = this.$route.params.isSlideshow;\r\n        },\r\n\t\tdata() {\r\n\t\t\treturn {\r\n\t\t\t\tmsg: 'Welcome to the Digital / Intersect section'\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n</script>\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n#app {\r\n\twidth: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\nheader {\r\n\ta {\r\n\t\tcolor: inherit;\r\n\t\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n.slicinItup {\r\n\tpadding-top: 0em;\r\n}\r\n\t\r\na {\r\n\r\n\tfont-size: 1em;\r\n\tfont-weight: bolder;\r\n}\r\n\r\nhr {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 2em;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2 {\r\n\tfont-size: 1.25em;\r\n\tcolor: #500606;\r\n\ttext-transform: capitalize;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh3 {\r\n\tcolor: #bc1d53;\r\n    text-transform: capitalize;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    padding: 1em .5em;\r\n    font-size: 1.75em;\r\n    background-color: black;\r\n    font-family: monospace;\r\n    line-height: 1.25em;\r\n\r\n\tspan {\r\n\t\tcolor: #065172;\r\n\t    text-transform: lowercase;\r\n\t    font-size: .55em;\r\n\t    display: block;\r\n\t    line-height: 1.75em;\r\n    \tmargin: 0 auto 1em;\r\n    \tpadding: 1em 0 0;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\ta {\r\n\t\ttext-transform : lowercase;\r\n\t\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n\t\tcolor: #72ff00c7;\r\n\t\tdisplay: none;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t&:hover {\r\n\t\tcursor: pointer;
